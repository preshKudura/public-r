            The Energy Hub Committee plays a diverse role in addressing various aspects of the energy industry, encompassing oil and gas, power, and
            renewable energy. It is responsible for identifying and tackling key reputational challenges within the sector by suggesting strategic PR
            solutions to support companies' License to Operate (LTO) and Freedom to Grow (FTG). Collaboration between the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR)
            and the energy industry is a key focus, along with developing tailored PR capacity building programmes and executing Reputation Management initiatives.
            The committee also ensures compliance with PR practitioner registration, activates dormant corporate memberships, recommends benefits for state chapters,
            proposes a suitable brand identity for the hub, and ultimately seeks to attract professional, reputational, and financial value to the Institute through these endeavors.
            <br><br> Enterprise Hub Committee
            The Enterprise Hub has the responsibility of creating a sustainable revenue base for the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) through marketplace
             enterprises. This involves designing and developing an effective platform, recommending an appropriate corporate name, and identifying credible stakeholders
              to drive the initiative. The committee is tasked with crafting the Vision, Mission, Objective, and Mandate of the Enterprise in alignment with NIPR's status.
               It will also determine the nature of businesses to be engaged, propose an organizational structure, and identify unique selling points based on existing talents
               and skills within the Institute. Recommendations will consider how the host and other participating State Chapters can benefit, with a focus on the core values
               of Professional, Reputational, and Financial Value for the Institute
