            The Masterclass is a window of opportunity provided by the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations that offers individuals without
            background in communication or related disciplines a unique opportunity to become members of the Institute. This pathway allows
            interested applicants to undergo executive training and subsequently be inducted into the Institute. Upon certification,
            participants are equipped with the knowledge of public relations principles and ethics, prepared to practice professionally
